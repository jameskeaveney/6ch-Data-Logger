Autodesk Inventor drawings for a basic front panel design including 9 BNC (8 input, 1 output) and 1 USB-B connector for powering the Arduino inside.

The USB-B panel mount connector has an internal cable with a Micro-USB (male) connector on the other end, and can be bought (very cheaply) from here:

The panel is designed around this housing:

The internal mount has 4 screw holes for the arduino via 4 M2.5 standoffs. It is designed to fit into the slots of the enclosure.
